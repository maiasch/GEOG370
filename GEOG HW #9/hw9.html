<h1>Homework 9: Make a choropleth or proportional symbol map </h1>
<h2>Maia Schweikert</h2>
<h3>The following map illustrates the concentration in ozone throughout the state of New York in ppm. As the concentration increases, the size of the marker increases as illustrated in the legend. I chose this topic because I am interested in environmental health, and have previously discussed the differences in environmental health depending on where you live. The state of New York has a range of both urban and rural areas, therefore I thoight it would be appropriate to see difference of pollution in the city and the less populated areas.</h3>
