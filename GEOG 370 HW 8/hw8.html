<h1>Homework 8 </h1>

<h3>The ratio presented in the maps below represented the population of white people that are classified as impoverished out of the total impoverished population of Montana in each county. To create this ratio the amount of white people living in poverty was divided by the total population living in poverty. This decimal was multiplied by 100 to present the data as if each county had a population of only 100 people.</h3>

    <p1> The equal count or quantile classification places equal amounts of data into each class. This method is most useful for data that is evenly spread throughout the setâ€™s range, therefore emphasizing the relative position of data values. The main disadvantage to using this method is that data within the same class can often greatly differ, perhaps presenting a skewed relation of observations. In this map, all of the classes are well represented, however this is only because the scale regarding the first classes is very broad and disproportional. </p1>

    </a> 


    <p2> The equal interval classification creates data classes of equal size, with the amount in each class determined by the maker. For example, in this map, I chose to create 5 equal interval classes. This method is most useful for classifying continuous data sets and is also advantageous because it creates a legend that is easy to understand. A disadvantage of this method is that the data will likely end up falling into one or two categories, as can be seen in this map.</p2>

    <p3> The map with data classified using natural breaks looks similar to map whose data was classified as equal interval, however they are not necessarily always similar. Natural breaks classes are created to group similar data together, therefore maximizing the difference between classes. This classification method is more useful when grouping data that is unevenly distributed but not necessarily skewed. Like the quantile classification method one potential disadvantage is the possibility of a wide range of data values within a single class. </p3>
