    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    
    
    <p>Using the Qqis software, I was able to modify a single map by devloping it 
        in several different projections. First I began by adding a vector layer of 
        a global map, with data provided by "Natural Earth." After my map was displayed, 
        I went to the Coordinate Reference System tab under Project Properties. At this
        point I was able to select which projections I wanted to display on said map by
        entering some version of the name of said projection in the filter section. Once 
        I applied the altering projection, I also applied the Indicatrix Mapping function 
        to provide a refernce point, therefore seeing if changes in size or shape had 
        been made to create the 2-dimensional projection.</p>
    
    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>The WGS84 projection does not appear to distort the location of mapped data, however 
        area, shape, and distance seem distorted.</h3>

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>The Aitoff projection distorts many apsects of the map, such as shapes, area, distance 
        and direction.</h3>

    <h2>Pseudo Mercator Projection</h2>
    <h3>The Psuedo Mercator projection is similar to the WGS84 projection in that it does not 
        appear to alter relative location of mapped objects, however, unlike the WGS84 the shape
        is also unchanged. There is evident distortion with distance and area.</h3>

    <h2>Sphere Winkel Projection</h2>
    <h3>The Sphere Winkel projection models the shape of an ellipsoid. There are distortions 
        regarding area, shape, distance, direction and angles. </h3>

    <h2>World Equidistant Conic Projection</h2>
    <h3>The World Equidistant Conic projection appears to distort distance, area, shape. The 
        distortion increases as one travels farther north or south from the standard line. 
        Because of this, regions in mid-latitude areas are most accurately portrayed.</h3>

    <h2>North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant Projection</h2>
    <h3>The North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant projection is similar to the conic projection in that 
        distortion increases as one travels farher north or south from the standard line, however it 
        seems to remain true to distance and direction.</h3>

    <h2>Sphere Craster Parabolic Projection</h2>
    <h3>The Sphere Craster Parabolic projection maintains the area, but greatly distorts shape and direction.</h3>

    <h2>Mollweide Projection</h2>
    <h3>The Mollweide projection, like the Sphere Craster projection is an equal-area projection. The overall
        shape of the distortion appears to mirror an ellipsoid.</h3>
