<h1>Homework 10: Geoprocessing Analysis </h1>
<h2>Maia Schweikert</h2>
<h3>Question: Are there potentially hazardous brownfield sites in urban areas in North Carolina? If so, where are they located?</h3>
<p> The map below shows the EPA registered brownfield sites that are located within a 1/2 mile of urban areas in North Carolina. The "Urban Areas" of NC were defined by the Department of Transportation. To create this map I used the intersect geoprocessing tool to first isolate only the urban areas in NC because the shapefile originally spanned partially across South Carolina. Then I ued the intersect tool with the browfield buffer layer and the urban areas layer to show only brownfields within that designated area. I also created the aforementioned 1/2 mile buffer using the buffer tool with the brownfield layer.  </p>
