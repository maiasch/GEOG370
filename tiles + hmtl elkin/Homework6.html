Without proper care, the bridge became irreparable and unnecessary due to the presence of another bridge only blocks away. The bridge was torn down in 2010, which is why it is present on the historical image, but is no longer visible in the Open Street Map. </p><img src='https://images.fineartamerica.com/images-medium-large-5/hugh-chatham-memorial-bridge-keith-hall.jpg'width='300px'/>";
